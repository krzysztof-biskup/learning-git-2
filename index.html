    <h1>The Weeknd - False Alarm</h1>
    <p>
        Bathroom stalls for the powder nose (she loves)
        High heel shoes with the open toes (she loves)
        She's got a good time wrapped in gold (she loves)
        For you, for you
        All red dress with the devil eyes (she loves)
        So obsessed with the camera lights (she loves)
        You love her, but you can't deny (she loves)
        The truth, the truth

        She loves everybody
        Can't you tell by the signs?
        She loves everybody
        She gets off all the time
        It's a dark philosophy
        And it haunts her constantly
        It's a false alarm to me
        She's a false alarm
    </p>
    <p>
        False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey) 
        False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey) 
        False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey) 
        False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey) 
        False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey) 
        False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey) 
      
        Six inch long, 'bout three inch wide (she loves) 
        Dolla, dolla bill is her only type (she loves)
        You love her but you'll never be (she loves) 
        The one, the one
        Diamonds and the rings are her fantasy (she loves) 
        She chase hearts with the Hennessy (she loves) 
        You love her, but you'll never be (she loves)
        Enough, enough
    </p>
    <p>
        She loves everybody
        Can't you tell by the signs?
        She loves everybody

        She always leaves the man she loves
        But the diamonds are forever
        She always seems to be alone
        But the diamonds make it better
